## Overview

Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (UCEC) is a type of cancer that originates from the lining of the uterus, known as the endometrium. This repository contains Python code for analyzing data related to Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (UCEC). The project includes scripts for data processing, analysis, and visualization.

## What is Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma?

- **Uterine Corpus**: Refers to the main body of the uterus.
- **Endometrial**: Pertains to the endometrium, the inner lining of the uterus.
- **Carcinoma**: A type of cancer that starts in the epithelial cells, which are the cells lining the surfaces of the body, including the endometrium.

## Key Facts

- **Prevalence**: UCEC is the most common type of uterine cancer.
- **Population**: Primarily affects postmenopausal women but can occur at any age.
- **Symptoms**: The primary symptom is often abnormal uterine bleeding, especially after menopause.
- **Risk Factors**: Include obesity, hormone replacement therapy, certain genetic conditions, and other factors affecting hormone levels.

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis typically involves:
- **Pelvic Examination**
- **Imaging Studies**: Such as ultrasound.
- **Biopsy**: Of the endometrial tissue.

## Treatment

Treatment depends on the stage and grade of the cancer but often includes:
- **Surgery**: Hysterectomy (removal of the uterus).
- **Radiation Therapy**
- **Chemotherapy**
- **Hormone Therapy**


## Key Features

- **Data Processing**: Scripts for cleaning and preparing UCEC data.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Functions for performing statistical analysis on UCEC data.
- **Visualization**: Tools for creating visualizations to better understand the data.
